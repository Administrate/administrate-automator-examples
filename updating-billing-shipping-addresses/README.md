## Problem

Some Organizations only receive a Default address from Students. This is the same as their Billing & Shipping and if it is missing it can cause problems with taking payments or sending materials.

## Automator Solution

The Automator looks at any Account that is Created or Updated. If it is missing all the primary fields, it will copy the Default Address to the Billing and Shipping fields.
