# Merge Accounts

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-05

## Problem

Some Accounts are duplicated either during a sync from an external HRIS or CRM system, or from Bookings or by human error. This creates a messy CRM and potential for miscommunication.

## Automator Solution

When the Webhook URL is clicked, the User is prompted to enter the Account IDs they wish to merge. One click and the Accounts are merged.

Future enhancements here would be to authenticate the form to the User's credentials and merge more data (such as Training Passes).
