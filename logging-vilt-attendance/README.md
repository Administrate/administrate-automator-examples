# Logging vILT Attendance

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-05

## Problem

When running vILT Events, Users find it cumbersome and time consuming logging into Zoom/Teams etc to find out who attended. They then need to go back into Administrate and log the attendance.

## Automator Solution

Once this workflow is configured and Active, the Automator dropdown on events should have the option "Record Zoom Attendance". Using this option will take the primary email address of the event's learners and compare that with the list of participants from the Zoom meeting. If there is a match, their attendance will be recorded in Administrate.
